     <h2>Challenge</h2>
	 <p>For this lab, our challenge is to write a hihg-level tasks and learn pseudocode.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="minor-section">
     <h2>Problems</h2>
     <p>During this lab, we encountered some problems:</p>
	 <ol>
		<li>Firstly, it is a little bit difficult for us to write high-level tasks.</li>
        <li>Secondly, we spend some time editng html code for the format of the webpage and add JS lists into the html file.</li>
      </ol>
   </div>


   <div class="minor-section">
     <div id="output"></div>
	 <h2>Results</h2>
	 <div>
	   <p>After doing some research on Google, we fix all issues and here are our work</p>
